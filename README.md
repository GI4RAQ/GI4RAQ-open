# GI4RAQ-open
Open-source repository for the air quality code which is called upon by the 'Green Infrastructure for Roadside Air Quality' (GI4RAQ) project.

In the main folder location (GI4RAQ/GI4RAQ-open) you will find the live version of the air quality code that is called upon by the user interface, and the meteorological data for 15 stations across the UK on which it relies.

For specific 'offline' versions which have been conducted to compare modelled results to measured concentrations and previous studies, head to the 'applied case studies' folder. Here you will find the relevant scripts and accompanying information. If you wish to run these for yourself, it is advised to do so within the Spyder RDE (downloadable via Anaconda navigator). You need only then press the green 'play' button for the results to be printed to the screen. Variations of the scripts can also be run: for example, you may substitute the NO2 concentrations within the Marylebone script with the NOx background and emission values to obtain NOx modelled concentrations (be aware the message printed to the screen and all variables will still be referred to as 'NO2' but the concentrations will change). Similarly, for the Gromke et al (2016) comparison, you are able to run the script with different heights of barriers and different obstruction %s - simply change the values in lines 25-55, press play, and the results will print to the screen.
